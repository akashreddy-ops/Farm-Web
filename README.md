ðŸŒ¾ Farm Web â€“ Smart Farming Solution ðŸšœ
Iâ€™m currently working on Farm Web, a project I started during a 36-hour hackathon in my first year. This platform is designed to help farmers and agricultural businesses by providing smart solutions for crop management, weather analysis, and resource optimization.

ðŸ“Œ Features of Farm Web (Work in Progress):
âœ… Crop Suggestions â€“ AI-based recommendations based on soil & weather conditions.
âœ… Weather Forecasting â€“ Real-time updates to help farmers plan better.
âœ… Market Insights â€“ Price tracking for crops to help with better selling decisions.
âœ… Farming Tips & Guides â€“ Best practices and techniques for improving yield.
âœ… User-Friendly Interface â€“ Simple and accessible for all users.

ðŸ”§ Technologies Used (So Far):
ðŸ”¹ HTML, CSS, JavaScript â€“ For the frontend interface.
ðŸ”¹ Backend (In Progress) â€“ Planning to integrate Python/Node.js.
ðŸ”¹ API Integration â€“ For weather and crop data.

ðŸŽ¯ Goals for the Project:
ðŸ”¹ Improve usability for farmers with simple UI/UX.
ðŸ”¹ Add AI-based crop prediction & smart recommendations.
ðŸ”¹ Expand the platform for more agricultural features.
